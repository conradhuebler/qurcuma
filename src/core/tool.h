// Claude Generated 2026 - A tool is a named operation with a typed parameter
// schema and a structured result. The same records feed three consumers: the LLM
// session (which sends the schemas to the model and executes what it names), the
// command palette (which shows the parameterless ones), and ctest.
//
// Value types only -- no registry, no Qt Widgets -- so a module can declare tools
// without pulling the registry in.
