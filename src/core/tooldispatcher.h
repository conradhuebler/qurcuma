// Claude Generated 2026 - ToolRegistry::invoke() runs a handler on whatever thread
// asks. That is fine for a test and wrong for the application: the agent loop does
// not live on the GUI thread, and a handler reaching MoleculeViewer from anywhere
// else is a data race on the viewer's frame storage -- silent, not a crash.
//
// The dispatcher is the one place that knows about threads and about the audit
// trail. It must LIVE on the GUI thread; ToolAffinity::Gui handlers are posted to
// it and run there.
