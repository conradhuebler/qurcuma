### Directory Navigation & Workspace System (Foundation Complete)

**Phase 1-2: UI Navigation (Complete)**
- Added BreadcrumbBar widget: Clickable path segments replacing plain text label; users jump to parent dirs by clicking breadcrumb segments; Home shown as ~
- Enhanced Recent Files: RecentFileEntry struct with QDateTime timestamps; menu groups by date (Today/Yesterday/This Week/Older); shows context (filename with parent directory)

**Phase 3.1: Bookmark Foundation (Complete)**
- BookmarkItem struct: Hierarchical support with id, name, path, tags, color, parentId, isFolder, created timestamp
- Settings methods: bookmarks(), setBookmarks(), addBookmark(), removeBookmark(), updateBookmark()
- Serialization: Pipe-delimited format in QSettings with auto-migration from legacy workingDirectories
- Ready for UI: Tree widget integration deferred to next iteration

**Phase 4.1-4.2: Workspace Foundation (Complete)**
- Workspace struct: Captures complete state - working directory, calculation directories, window geometry, splitter states, timestamps
- WorkspaceManager class: Methods for save/restore/list/delete/rename workspace operations
- Settings persistence: All workspace data serialized and persisted in QSettings
- Ready for UI: Sidebar widget and menu integration deferred to next iteration

**Context Menu Activation (Bonus)**
- Enabled missing setupProjectViewContextMenu() call in MainWindow constructor
- Right-click on calculation directories now shows context menu: "Add to Bookmarks", "Set as Working Directory"

## October 2025

- Fixed VTF bond parsing: Changed QMap<int, VTFBond> to QVector<VTFBond> to support multiple bonds per atom (previously lost ~50% of bonds due to key collision)
- Fixed VTF frame parsing: Removed global parseError flag from main loop; now correctly processes all frame sections (was stopping after first conversion error, returning 0 frames instead of 3)
- Added test infrastructure: test_vtf_bonds.cpp (validates 199 bonds), test_vtf_frames.cpp (detects 3 frames), test_vtf_full.cpp (end-to-end validation)
